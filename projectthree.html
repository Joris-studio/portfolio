            <p>UX restructure | Journey mapping<br>ILGM had succesfully grown into a platform offering Content, Community and Commerce. It was all separate though, so I paved the way towards a merged experience.</p>

                <h2>Phase 1: analysis</h2>
                <h3>Most of the interaction was disjointed.</h3>
                <p>Take a look at the visualization below. Changing the contents and drilling down on the data in the table is an ongoing task for the airlinesâ€™ analysts. Therefore, the method should be intuitive and fast. The analysis, as shown in the visual, is not efficient; on the contrary, it requires the user to move back and forth over the table.<br><br>

                    I would define the ideal structure of any digital service to focus on solving its most popular use cases. The challenge for NN was solving this with a lack of user insights as we had to rebuild the app without any available research. So we needed a form of information architecture that would support all content and services. One that users would understand - so on the longer run, we could address actual use cases.<br>Imagine being able to accomplish everything right where you need it. This way, you get your results quickly and can easily iterate on them moving forward.<br>
                    With this many products getting lost would get very easy. Especially since the list of products shared so little - other than being financial. I applied a simple blueprint all content had to adhere to. This way, your way home was never difficult. The top layer features the full list; one level down is for an individual product and any funnel within this product would be on the third level. So wherever you are: two levels up and you're home.</p>

After this initial setup the app was built and user research started to find out what use cases we should be matching.</p>
