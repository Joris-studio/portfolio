  <h3>Analysis proved: the structure was missing altogether.</h3>
  <p>I started mapping out the main journeys but failed. This platform had grown into a broken construct over time. Still I stuck to the project's brief - whose guardrails did not allow me to work on the structure. I focused on having the user understand how your pension plans' money correlates with your age.</p>

  <p>Especially the mobile version was one big pile of spaghetti... CTAs only to be found once you swipe twice, no visual hierarchy. All this, while roughly 50% of traffic currently is mobile.</p>

  <h3>The approach</h3>
  <p>I designed a task-oriented prototype based on progressive disclosure — showing information step by step, only when the user needs it. Contrary to the platforms' current approach, I shortened the users' journey getting to the facts. And by simplifying the overview, the user now was able to interact with their financials directly.</p>
  <p>We tested the prototype with real users. At the same time, I used it to help the client team see that principles like task focus and information hierarchy aren’t abstract theory — they’re what make complex content understandable.</p>

  <h3>The outcome</h3>

  <p>The prototype made users understand pensions by playing around with age and its financial outcomes. They recognised this as more effective and personalised than reading about it. While the client was stating "users don't read" they now learned more: it's not about reading, it's about making the abstract into something tangible, - your pension on a certain age. The results were clear: users found the content easier to follow and understood what to do next. The client, initially sceptical, was pleasantly surprised. Please have a look at the prototype for yourself!</p>

  <p>It opened up a broader conversation: how could we apply the same structure across the rest of the site? And how could we use data to measure and improve it further?</p>

  <h3>The impact</h3>

  <p>The project didn’t just deliver a better prototype. It changed how the client thought about design — structure isn’t decoration, it’s the foundation of a usable platform.</p>
