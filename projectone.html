  <h3>Analysis proved: the structure was missing altogether.</h3>
  <p>I started mapping out the main journeys but failed. This platform had grown into a broken construct over time. Still I stuck to the project's brief - whose guardrails did not allow me to work on the structure. I focused on having the user understand how your pension plans' money correlates with your age.</p>

  <p>Especially the mobile version was one big pile of spaghetti...</p>

  <p>Too much white space, too little clarity on what to do as a user.</p>
  <h3>The approach</h3>
  <p>I designed a task-oriented prototype based on progressive disclosure — showing information step by step, only when the user needs it.</p>
  <p>We tested the prototype with real users. At the same time, I used it to help the client team see that principles like task focus and information hierarchy aren’t abstract theory — they’re what make complex content understandable.</p>

  <h3>The outcome</h3>

  </div>

  <p>The results were clear: users found the content easier to follow and understood what to do next. The client, initially sceptical, was pleasantly surprised.</p>
  <p>It opened up a broader conversation: how could we apply the same structure across the rest of the site? And how could we use data to measure and improve it further?</p>

  <h3>The impact</h3>

  <p>The project didn’t just deliver a better prototype. It changed how the client thought about design — structure isn’t decoration, it’s the foundation of a usable platform.</p>
