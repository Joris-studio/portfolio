                <h2>Phase 1: analysis</h2>
                <h3>Most of the interaction was disjointed.</h3>
                <p>Take a look at the visualization below. Changing the contents and drilling down on the data in the table is an ongoing task for the airlinesâ€™ analysts. Therefore, the method should be intuitive and fast. The analysis, as shown in the visual, is not efficient; on the contrary, it requires the user to move back and forth over the table.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine being able to accomplish everything right where you need it. This way, you get your results quickly and can easily iterate on them moving forward.
                    <br><br>
                <h2>Phase II: solutions</h2>
                 <p>The approach shown above was clearly not going to work. Modals can be used for initial setup, but they are not suitable for overly complex actions. Even if it did work, it would still be preferable to handle these actions locally, allowing you to get what you need immediately. </p>

After this initial setup the app was built and user research started to find out what use cases we should be matching.</p>
