                <h2>The challenge</h2>
                <h3>No surprise: the structure was missing altogether.</h3>
                <p>And since pensions are a complex topic, small fixes weren’t going to help. Instead of polishing the surface, I proposed to start with the underlying structure.</p>

                <h2>The approach</h2>
                <p>I designed a task-oriented prototype based on progressive disclosure — showing information step by step, only when the user needs it.
We tested the prototype with real users. At the same time, I used it to help the client team see that principles like task focus and information hierarchy aren’t abstract theory — they’re what make complex content understandable.

                <p>The results were clear: users found the content easier to follow and understood what to do next. The client, initially sceptical, was pleasantly surprised.
It opened up a broader conversation: how could we apply the same structure across the rest of the site? And how could we use data to measure and improve it further?</p>
                <h2>The impact</h2>
                <img class="right-image" src="images/MPO design.png" alt="architecture"><p>
                <p>The project didn’t just deliver a better prototype. It changed how the client thought about design — structure isn’t decoration, it’s the foundation of a usable platform.</p>
